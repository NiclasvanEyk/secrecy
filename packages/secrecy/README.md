# Secrecy

🔏 A unified Python API for managing secrets.

## Getting Started

> [!WARNING]
> If you just want to use secrets, don't install this package directly!
> By itself it can **not** be used to manage secrets!
> Instead, have a look at the [list of supported drivers](https://github.com/NiclasvanEyk/secrecy/tree/main#ecosystem) and install one from there.
> This package only includes the interfaces and core functionality used by the more specialized ecosystem packages.

```shell
pip install secrecy
```
